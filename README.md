# IPL_Powerplay_ScorePrediction
The project aims at Predicting the IPL score at the end of six overs using ANN implemented using Tensorflow framework. The input data consisted of the factors-venue, batsmen, bowlers for the first six overs. The input data is pre-processed using label encoding on the stadium, one hot encodng on it's dummies, deriving useful secondary information from the raw data, dropping unecessary data that doesn't affect the label and handling NULL values appropriately.It is a Regression problem that finally predicts the score as numeric data. The model has successfully performed on validation data which was the details of IPL 2021 with an apprecible accuracy.
